i'd like to make a shortcut in zsh that works in the following way.

i often do:

```zsh
git add . && git commit -m "my commit message"
```

can i turn this into a shortcut? ideally, it would like even simpler:

```zsh
gacm my commit message
```

is this possible? how do i do this?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely, you can achieve this in **zsh** (and bash, too) by creating a function in your shell config (usually `~/.zshrc`). Here‚Äôs how you can do exactly what you described:

---

### 1. Open your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 2. Add this function at the end:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `$*` combines all the arguments you pass to the function into one string, so `gacm my commit message` becomes `"my commit message"`.

---

### 3. Save and reload your config:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 4. Done!  
Now you can use:

```zsh
gacm my commit message
```

and it‚Äôll run:

```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "my commit message"
```

---

#### **Bonus: Suggested improvement**

If you want a shorthand for committing **all staged changes only** (without auto-adding), you could do:

```zsh
gcm() {
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

But for your use-case, `gacm` as above is exactly what you want.

**Let me know if you want any more git or zsh shortcuts!**

# === USER ===

i am using oh-my-zsh, does it have other shortcuts i should know about?

# === ASSISTANT ===

**Yes! Oh My Zsh** comes with many helpful git shortcuts (aliases and functions), especially if the [git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) is enabled. It's enabled by default in many setups. Here‚Äôs how to check and some highlights:

---

## 1. **Is the git plugin enabled?**

Open your `~/.zshrc` file and look for:

```zsh
plugins=(git)
```
If `git` is in that list, you have the built-in git shortcuts!

---

## 2. **Some of the most useful Oh My Zsh git aliases:**

| Alias     | Command Equivalent                         | Description                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `gst`     | `git status`                              | Show status                                       |
| `gl`      | `git pull`                                | Pull from upstream                                |

| `gr`      | `git remote`                              | List remotes                                      |
| `gcl`     | `git clone`                               | Clone a repository                                |

## 3. **Try some in your terminal:**

```zsh
gst    # git status
gco dev-branch    # git checkout dev-branch
gca "Your commit message"    # git commit -a -m "Your commit message"
gp     # git push
```

---

## 4. **Why is this useful?**

- **Shortens typing** for common git tasks.
- **Consistency**: You‚Äôll find the same aliases everywhere Oh My Zsh is set up.
- **Many options**: They include common and some advanced actions.

---

## 5. **Pro Tip:**  
You can always view all current ‚Äòg‚Äô aliases with:

```zsh
alias | grep '^g'
```
or  
```zsh
alias | grep git
```

Let me know if you want recommendations for other essential plugins or zsh tricks!

# === USER ===

i'd like to make an update to this shortcut. is there any way to also display what files have just been changed/updated/added with this command?

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely!  
You can enhance your `gacm` function to **show exactly which files were added, changed, or updated**.

## üü¢ **Option 1: Show files added by git add**

You can use `git status --short` **before** you add, or better, use `git diff --cached --name-status` **after** you add, but **before** you commit:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  echo "Staged changes:"
  git diff --cached --name-status
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

- `git diff --cached --name-status` lists the files staged for commit, with their status (A=added, M=modified, D=deleted).

### **Sample output:**
```
Staged changes:
M file1.txt
A newfile.txt
D oldfile.txt
[commit output...]
```

---

## üü¢ **Option 2: Show summary after commit**

If you want to see what files were part of **just this commit**, you can use `git show --name-status --oneline HEAD` after committing:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in last commit:"
  git show --name-status --oneline HEAD | tail -n +2
}
```
- This will show the latest commit summary and list files changed in that commit.

---

## üü¢ **Recommended combo:**  
Best is probably to see what‚Äôs being staged **before** and what was just committed **after**:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  echo "Staged for commit:"
  git diff --cached --name-status
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in latest commit:"
  git show --name-status --oneline HEAD | tail -n +2
}
```

---

## üí° **Tip**
- `git diff --cached --name-only` will show just the file names (without M/A/D status).
- You can adjust the level of detail as you prefer.

---

**Just copy/paste one of these into your `~/.zshrc`!**  
Let me know if you want a different format or extra info like diff stats!

# === USER ===

this seems to take over my screen. is there a way to just print out the results?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely! If you're finding that commands like `git show` print a huge diff, it's because by default `git show` and `git log -p` display *the full diff* of each file.

If you **only want the filenames (and their status)** that were staged and committed, but **not the full diff or commit messages**, here‚Äôs the cleanest way:

---

## üöÄ **Minimal Staged Files Output:**

**Just show filenames and status:**

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  echo "Staged for commit:"
  git diff --cached --name-status
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

---

## üöÄ **Minimal Last Commit Output:**

**Show only the files changed in the last commit:**

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in last commit:"
  git show --name-status --no-patch --oneline HEAD
}
```
- The `--no-patch` option in `git show` suppresses the full diff, so you'll see only the commit summary and filenames.

---

## üöÄ **Even More Minimal ‚Äì Only Files, No Status Letters:**

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in last commit:"
  git show --name-only --no-patch --oneline HEAD
}
```

---

## üìù **Pick the style you like best.**
All of these will **not flood your screen**; they print just the commit (or staged) filenames, not full diffs.

Add your version to `~/.zshrc`, then `source ~/.zshrc` to activate.

# === USER ===

is this the right way to alias python?

```zsh
alias py="python"
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, your syntax is correct!  
To set up an alias for `python`, you can **add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:**

```zsh
alias py="python"
```

After saving, you need to reload your shell configuration with:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, typing `py` will run `python`.

---

**A couple of things to consider:**

### 1. **Python version:**
Depending on your system, `python` may refer to Python 2 or Python 3.  
Many modern systems use `python3` as the command.

If you want `py` to always mean Python 3 (recommended!), use:

```zsh
alias py="python3"
```

### 2. **Check what `python` points to:**

```zsh
python --version
python3 --version
```
See which one you want to alias.

---

**Summary:**  
- Yes, `alias py="python"` is the right form.  
- Consider using `alias py="python3"` to avoid confusion on modern systems.  

Let me know if you need help with other aliases!

# === USER ===

isn't there a way to enable vim mode for zsh? how do i do that?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes! **You can enable vim mode in Zsh very easily.** This lets you navigate and edit your command line in normal/insert modes, just like in Vim.

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Enable Vim Mode in Zsh:**

Add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
bindkey -v
```

Save and then reload your config:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## üß† **How it works**

- You'll start in *insert* mode (like Vim's insert).
- Press `Esc` to go to *normal* mode (for command navigation/editing).
- In normal mode, you can use:
  - `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move the cursor
  - `w`, `b`, `e` for word movement
  - `x` to delete a character
  - `i` to return to insert mode
  - `v` to start selecting (visual mode)
  - And more ‚Äî just like Vim!

---

## üåÄ **Optional Improvements: Visual indicator for mode**

Some people add a visual cue to their prompt for which mode they're in. (Let me know if you want instructions for that!)

---

## üèÅ **That's it!**

Now you have vim-style editing in your Zsh command line.  
Let me know if you want tips for using it, or for a mode-indicator prompt!
