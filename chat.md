i'd like to make a shortcut in zsh that works in the following way.

i often do:

```zsh
git add . && git commit -m "my commit message"
```

can i turn this into a shortcut? ideally, it would like even simpler:

```zsh
gacm my commit message
```

is this possible? how do i do this?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely, you can achieve this in **zsh** (and bash, too) by creating a function in your shell config (usually `~/.zshrc`). Hereâ€™s how you can do exactly what you described:

---

### 1. Open your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 2. Add this function at the end:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `$*` combines all the arguments you pass to the function into one string, so `gacm my commit message` becomes `"my commit message"`.

---

### 3. Save and reload your config:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 4. Done!  
Now you can use:

```zsh
gacm my commit message
```

and itâ€™ll run:

```zsh
git add .
git commit -m "my commit message"
```

---

#### **Bonus: Suggested improvement**

If you want a shorthand for committing **all staged changes only** (without auto-adding), you could do:

```zsh
gcm() {
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

But for your use-case, `gacm` as above is exactly what you want.

i am using oh-my-zsh, does it have other shortcuts i should know about?

# === ASSISTANT ===

**Yes! Oh My Zsh** comes with many helpful git shortcuts (aliases and functions), especially if the [git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) is enabled. It's enabled by default in many setups. Hereâ€™s how to check and some highlights:

---

## 1. **Is the git plugin enabled?**

Open your `~/.zshrc` file and look for:

```zsh
plugins=(git)
```
If `git` is in that list, you have the built-in git shortcuts!

---

## 2. **Some of the most useful Oh My Zsh git aliases:**

| Alias     | Command Equivalent                         | Description                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `gst`     | `git status`                              | Show status                                       |
| `gl`      | `git pull`                                | Pull from upstream                                |

| `gcm`     | `git checkout master`                     | Checkout `master` branch                          |
| `gco`     | `git checkout`                            | Checkout any branch                               |
| `gaa`     | `git add --all`                           | Stage all changes                                 |
| `gc`      | `git commit -v`                           | Commit with verbose message editor                |
| `gca`     | `git commit -v -a`                        | Add and commit all tracked files                  |
| `gcam`    | `git commit -a -m "msg"`                  | Add and commit with inline message                |
| `gcm`     | `git commit -m "msg"`                     | Commit with inline message                        |
| `gr`      | `git remote`                              | List remotes                                      |
| `gcl`     | `git clone`                               | Clone a repository                                |
| `glog`    | `git log --oneline --decorate --color`    | Nicely formatted git log                          |

**There are dozens more!**

## 3. **Try some in your terminal:**

```zsh
gst    # git status
gco dev-branch    # git checkout dev-branch
gca "Your commit message"    # git commit -a -m "Your commit message"
gp     # git push
```

---

## 4. **Why is this useful?**

- **Shortens typing** for common git tasks.
- **Consistency**: Youâ€™ll find the same aliases everywhere Oh My Zsh is set up.
- **Many options**: They include common and some advanced actions.

---

## 5. **Pro Tip:**  
You can always view all current â€˜gâ€™ aliases with:

```zsh
alias | grep '^g'
```
or  
```zsh
alias | grep git
```

i'd like to make an update to this shortcut. is there any way to also display what files have just been changed/updated/added with this command?

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely!  
You can enhance your `gacm` function to **show exactly which files were added, changed, or updated**.

## ðŸŸ¢ **Option 1: Show files added by git add**

You can use `git status --short` **before** you add, or better, use `git diff --cached --name-status` **after** you add, but **before** you commit:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  echo "Staged changes:"
  git diff --cached --name-status
  git commit -m "$*"
}
```

- `git diff --cached --name-status` lists the files staged for commit, with their status (A=added, M=modified, D=deleted).

### **Sample output:**
```
Staged changes:
M file1.txt
A newfile.txt
D oldfile.txt
[commit output...]
```

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Option 2: Show summary after commit**

If you want to see what files were part of **just this commit**, you can use `git show --name-status --oneline HEAD` after committing:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in last commit:"
  git show --name-status --oneline HEAD | tail -n +2
}
```
- This will show the latest commit summary and list files changed in that commit.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Recommended combo:**  
Best is probably to see whatâ€™s being staged **before** and what was just committed **after**:

```zsh
gacm() {
  git add .
  echo "Staged for commit:"
  git diff --cached --name-status
  git commit -m "$*"
  echo "Files in latest commit:"
  git show --name-status --oneline HEAD | tail -n +2
}
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Tip**
- `git diff --cached --name-only` will show just the file names (without M/A/D status).
- You can adjust the level of detail as you prefer.

---

**Just copy/paste one of these into your `~/.zshrc`!**  
Let me know if you want a different format or extra info like diff stats!

this seems to take over my screen. is there a way to just print out the results?
